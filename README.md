# C# Console Hangman game

Hangman is a game where the player guesses a word letter by letter until they have either guessed the word, or run out of letters. Oftentimes this is illustrated by a man hanging from his neck from the gallows, hence the word "Hangman."

## Features

Grabs words from a web API rather than a built-in array of words. This does mean that the application requires an internet connection.

Allows the player to enter a whole word, guess letter by letter, or exit the application from the commandline using if-else statements and parsing methods.
